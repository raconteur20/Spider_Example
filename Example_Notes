# Variables are created when they are first assigned value.
# The value associated to a variable can be updated to a new value.
# Variables must be assigned before they can be used in expressions.

##Schematic of declaring of variable
#variable_name = value

#Variable Examples
name = "Gerard"
number = 15
month = "June"



Rules for Variable Names
1. Names cannot start with a number.
2. Names cannot contain spaces either. If you have more than one word in your variable, separate using an underscore "_" instead of spaces. For example: one_way_of_defining_variable = "example"
3. Names cannot contain any of the following special characters: ' " , < > / ? | ( ) ! @ # $ % & * - +
4. Names cannot be Python reserved words like with or not. Reserved words in Python include words for which Python has a special meaning.
5. Names starting with lowercase is considered to be a good practice. It is just a convention, not a rule.
